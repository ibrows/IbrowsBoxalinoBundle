Boxalino: Autocomplete, activating suggestions and highlighting
===============================================================

In order to fully use the autocompletion suggestions and highlighting from boxalino on a new index you will need to 
follow the steps as follows

* Log into your [boxalino account](http://di1.bx-cloud.com/frontend/dbmind/en/dbmind/login) and navigate to 
actions > task processes
   
* Select “edit” on the task process “autocomplete”  
    ![Task processes][1]


* Select the fields you wish to use from the "include_field_value" dropdown   
    ![Edit task processes][2]


* Click "update" in the top left hand side, followed by clicking the blue "execute" button        
      
* Then click "execute" again on this page    
    ![Autocompletion task][3]
    
    
* Once the indexing is complete, navigate to actions > files, then click to tab "outputs"   
    ![publish output][4]    
   
   
* Next to the last full export click the "publish" button, the last full index will be published, therefore it is not
advisable to do this in a production environment
