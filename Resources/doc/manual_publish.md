Boxalino: Manual Publishing of index
====================================

Boxalino will only publish an entity export (data import) when the number of rows is more than about 12. For this reason,
especially during the development phase (not enough data), or deployment to production phase (empty data) it is 
necessary to manually publish the last export.
 
Once the indexing is complete, navigate to actions > files, then click to tab "outputs", Next to the last full export 
click the "publish" button, the last full index will be published. It is only possible to publish full exports and not
delta exports.
